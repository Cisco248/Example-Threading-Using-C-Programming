## Introduction
- A condition variable is a synchronization primitive used in multithreaded programming to allow threads to wait for a specific condition to become true before proceeding. Condition variables are typically used in conjunction   with mutexes to manage access to shared resources.

## Here's an example to illustrate the concept of condition variables in C using pthreads:

            #define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 5
            
            int buffer[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE];
            int count = 0;
            
            pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
            pthread_cond_t cond_producer = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
            pthread_cond_t cond_consumer = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;
            
            void* producer(void* arg) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
                    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
          
                  // Check if the buffer is full
                  while (count == MAX_BUFFER_SIZE) {
                      // If the buffer is full, wait for the consumer to signal that space is available
                      pthread_cond_wait(&cond_producer, &mutex);
                  }
          
                  // Produce an item and add it to the buffer
                  buffer[count++] = i;
                  printf("Produced: %d\n", i);
          
                  // Signal the consumer that a new item is available
                  pthread_cond_signal(&cond_consumer);
          
                  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
                    }
          
              pthread_exit(NULL);
              }
          
                void* consumer(void* arg) {
                    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
                        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
          
                  // Check if the buffer is empty
                  while (count == 0) {
                      // If the buffer is empty, wait for the producer to signal that an item is available
                      pthread_cond_wait(&cond_consumer, &mutex);
                  }
          
                  // Consume an item from the buffer
                  int item = buffer[--count];
                  printf("Consumed: %d\n", item);
          
                  // Signal the producer that there is space in the buffer
                  pthread_cond_signal(&cond_producer);
          
                  pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
              }
          
              pthread_exit(NULL);
          }
      
          int main() {
              pthread_t producer_thread, consumer_thread;
          
              // Create threads
              pthread_create(&producer_thread, NULL, producer, NULL);
              pthread_create(&consumer_thread, NULL, consumer, NULL);
          
              // Wait for threads to finish
              pthread_join(producer_thread, NULL);
              pthread_join(consumer_thread, NULL);
          
              // Clean up resources
              pthread_mutex_destroy(&mutex);
              pthread_cond_destroy(&cond_producer);
              pthread_cond_destroy(&cond_consumer);
          
              return 0;
          }

In this example, a producer thread produces items and adds them to a shared buffer, while a consumer thread consumes items from the buffer. The condition variables cond_producer and cond_consumer are used to signal and wait for specific conditions.

Here's how it works:

- The pthread_cond_wait function is used to make a thread wait until a condition is signaled. It is always used inside a while loop that checks the actual condition because spurious wake-ups (unexpected wake-ups without a   real signal) can occur.

- When the producer adds an item to the buffer, it signals the consumer using pthread_cond_signal(&cond_consumer), indicating that there is an item available for consumption.

- The consumer, upon consuming an item, signals the producer using pthread_cond_signal(&cond_producer), indicating that there is space available in the buffer for a new item.

- The use of condition variables helps avoid busy-waiting and allows threads to sleep efficiently until the required condition is met, improving overall performance and resource utilization.

In summary, condition variables provide a way for threads to communicate about the state of shared data and coordinate their activities, enabling more efficient and synchronized multithreaded programming.
